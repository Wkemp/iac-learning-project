## preparation

### install jenkins server

First a point of communication and kick off is needed for deploying infrastructure.  To do that jenkins is used.  This will require a few servers to be deployed depending on the size and number of environments you are working in.

Minimum: 1 - jenkins controller, 1 - jenkins agent
